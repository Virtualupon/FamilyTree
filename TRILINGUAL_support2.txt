You are Claude Code acting as a senior localization / i18n engineer. Perform a MAJOR full-codebase localization audit of this repository: Angular frontend + .NET Core backend.

MISSION
Check the entire frontend and backend so that EVERY user-facing label, name, page text, error message, validation message, toast/snackbar, dialog/modal content, table header, status string, empty state, tooltip, and exported label (PDF/CSV/Excel/email templates) follows the currently selected language. No English-only strings should leak when another language is selected.

PRIMARY RULES
1) No hardcoded user-facing strings in Angular templates or TS (except translation keys).
2) All UI strings must be served from the translation system based on the selected language.
3) Backend must NOT return English display strings that end up rendered in the UI. Backend should return:
   - translation keys + optional parameters, OR
   - localized strings based on request culture (Accept-Language / culture cookie / route culture),
   depending on the chosen architecture.
4) Validation messages must be localized end-to-end:
   - Angular form validation messages
   - Server-side model validation (DataAnnotations / FluentValidation)
   - Exceptions / problem details
5) Date/number/currency formatting must follow locale.

DISCOVERY (DO THIS FIRST)
- Identify Angular version and i18n approach used (Angular built-in i18n, Transloco, ngx-translate, custom).
- Identify where language selection is stored (localStorage, cookie, URL, profile setting) and how it is applied.
- Identify .NET Core localization approach (IStringLocalizer, Resource (.resx) files, RequestLocalizationOptions, CultureProviders).
- Identify supported languages and fallback rules.
- Identify any shared “enum → label” maps, status dictionaries, or backend-driven dropdown lists.

DELIVERABLES (OUTPUT ALL)
A) Executive Summary (1 page)
- Current i18n architecture (Angular + .NET)
- Gaps that cause language mismatches
- Top 10 critical issues to fix first

B) Full Repo i18n Audit Report (exhaustive)
For EACH issue, include:
- file path + line numbers
- the exact hardcoded string (or culture leak)
- where it appears in the UI
- recommended fix with concrete translation key (namespace/key)
- parameters needed (e.g., {count}, {name})
- severity: CRITICAL/HIGH/MED/LOW

Group findings into:
1) Angular Templates (.html) hardcoded strings
2) Angular TS strings (components/services/interceptors/guards)
3) Angular Material strings (mat-paginator, datepicker, snackbars, dialogs)
4) Routing titles/breadcrumbs/nav items
5) Form validation messages (client)
6) .NET API responses that include display text (DTOs, errors, enums)
7) .NET validation messages (DataAnnotations/FluentValidation)
8) Exceptions, ProblemDetails, middleware error handling
9) Export/report/email/SMS templates
10) Shared constants / enums / status labels across FE/BE

C) Proposed Target Architecture (choose best fit for this codebase)
Provide TWO options with pros/cons and recommend ONE:
Option 1: UI-only translations (backend returns keys + params, FE translates)
Option 2: Dual-layer localization (backend localizes errors/validation via resx; FE localizes UI)
Include how to handle:
- enums/status values
- dropdown lists from API
- server validation errors mapped to localized messages
- fallback culture

D) Fix Plan (PR-sized steps, in correct order)
For each step:
- name
- exact files/directories to touch
- mechanical edits (what to replace with what)
- test/verification checklist

E) Standards + Guardrails
1) Translation key naming standard:
- namespaces by feature/module (e.g. auth.login.title)
- consistent casing
- no duplicated keys
2) Interpolation/plurals/gender rules
3) Locale formatting rules:
- dates, currency, numbers, units
4) Guardrails:
- lint rules (Angular ESLint) to detect raw strings in templates/TS
- CI script that scans for unlocalized strings in specific folders
- unit tests + e2e tests: switch language and assert the UI changes
- runtime dev warnings: missing translation keys

WHAT TO SEARCH FOR (BE AGGRESSIVE)
Angular Frontend
- Any raw text in .html templates (button labels, headings, placeholders, aria-labels)
- Any string literals in TS used for UI:
  - snackBar.open("...")
  - dialog data text
  - toastr messages
  - console-to-user errors
  - form validation messages
- Router config titles, breadcrumb labels, menu config
- Angular Material i18n adapters:
  - MatPaginatorIntl labels
  - DateAdapter locale
  - MatDatepicker strings
- Pipes that format date/number/currency without locale awareness
- Any “status label” maps like:
  const STATUS_LABELS = { Pending: "Pending", ... }

.NET Core Backend
- DTO fields that contain user-visible display strings (Name, StatusName, DisplayName, Message)
- Enum-to-string conversions, switch statements returning English
- ProblemDetails / exception middleware returning English messages
- DataAnnotations error messages hardcoded
- FluentValidation messages hardcoded
- Logging is fine, but anything returned to client must be localized or key-based
- Any templates (emails, PDFs, exports) using hardcoded English

OUTPUT FORMAT REQUIREMENTS
- Use clear section headers A–E.
- For report items, output as a table-like list:
  [Severity] Path:LineRange | Hardcoded: "..." | Where shown | Fix: key=... namespace=... params=...
- Be exhaustive. If you can’t scan some generated files (dist), say so and focus on source.

START NOW
1) Scan the repo structure (Angular app folders, .NET solution/projects).
2) Identify current i18n/localization mechanisms.
3) Produce the full audit + fix plan + standards + guardrails.
