You are a senior .NET 8 / ASP.NET Core + Angular architect.

I have a working media upload feature for Persons. Two enhancements needed WITHOUT breaking existing code:

ISSUE 1: MEDIA UPLOAD - ADD PERSON TAGGING

Current: Media uploads successfully but does not allow linking/tagging other persons.

Required: When uploading media, user should be able to tag/link multiple persons.

Frontend changes:
- Add multi-select person picker (searchable dropdown) to upload dialog/form
- Pre-select current person being viewed
- Allow selecting additional persons to tag
- Send PersonIds array with upload request

Backend changes:
- Update upload DTO to accept PersonIds (List of int)
- Create PersonMedia link records for each selected person
- Use transaction to ensure Media + all links created together

Upload flow should be:
1. User clicks upload on Person A's media tab
2. Upload dialog shows file picker + person multi-select (Person A pre-selected)
3. User can add Person B, Person C etc.
4. Submit creates 1 Media record + PersonMedia links for A, B, C

ISSUE 2: PERSON LIST - MEDIA INDICATOR

Current: No way to know if a person has media without going to Details > Media tab.

Required: Show visual indicator on person list/card when person has media.

Backend changes:
- Add HasMedia (bool) or MediaCount (int) to Person list DTO
- Update Person list query to include media count via LEFT JOIN or subquery
- Example: SELECT p.*, (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM PersonMedia pm WHERE pm.PersonId = p.Id) as MediaCount

Frontend changes:
- On person list/card view, show indicator when MediaCount > 0
- Options: badge icon, media icon with count, colored dot, or chip
- Example: camera/image icon next to person name, or badge showing "3 media"

Suggested UI indicators (pick one):
- Small camera/media icon appears if HasMedia = true
- Badge with count like "📷 5" 
- Colored dot/indicator
- Tooltip on hover showing "Has 5 media files"

DELIVERABLES:

1. Backend DTO updates for PersonIds in upload
2. Backend service update to create links in transaction
3. Backend Person list DTO with MediaCount or HasMedia
4. Backend query optimization for media count
5. Frontend upload dialog with person multi-select
6. Frontend person list showing media indicator
7. Keep existing functionality working

OUTPUT: Provide code changes with clear file paths. Focus on minimal changes to existing code.
