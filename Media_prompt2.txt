Two enhancements needed for Person Media feature WITHOUT breaking existing code:

FEATURE 1: MEDIA DESCRIPTION FIELD

Required: Each media file should have an optional description field.

Backend changes:
- Add Description (string, nullable, max 500 chars) to Media entity if not exists
- Add Description to upload DTO
- Add Description to response DTOs
- Update migration if needed

Frontend changes:
- Add description textarea to upload dialog/form
- Display description under each media item in gallery/list view
- Make it optional (not required)
- Show placeholder text like "Add a description..." if empty

FEATURE 2: CLEAR VISUAL MEDIA INDICATOR ON PERSON LIST

Required: When viewing person list/table/cards, it must be VERY CLEAR and OBVIOUS which persons have media files attached.

Backend changes:
- Add HasMedia (bool) or MediaCount (int) to Person list DTO
- Query: include count from PersonMedia junction table
- Return this field in all person list endpoints

Frontend changes - make it HIGHLY VISIBLE:
- Option A: Colored badge with icon and count (e.g. blue badge with camera icon + "3")
- Option B: Row highlight or background tint for persons with media
- Option C: Prominent icon column in table view
- Option D: Media thumbnail preview chip

Recommended implementation:
- Add dedicated column or badge area in person list/table
- Use contrasting color (blue, green) so it stands out
- Show icon + count like: 🖼️ 5 or 📷 3
- If MediaCount = 0, show nothing or grey "No media"
- Make it clickable to jump directly to person's media tab

Example visual:

Person Name     | Age | Media
----------------|-----|----------------
John Smith      | 32  | 📷 5 (blue badge)
Jane Doe        | 28  | (empty/grey)
Bob Wilson      | 45  | 🎬 2 (blue badge)

DELIVERABLES:

1. Media entity: Description field (string, nullable)
2. Upload DTO: Description field
3. Response DTOs: Description field
4. Upload form: Description textarea
5. Media display: Show description
6. Person list DTO: MediaCount or HasMedia field
7. Person list query: Include media count efficiently
8. Person list UI: Prominent visual indicator with icon and count
9. Optional: Click indicator to navigate to media tab

PRIORITY: The media indicator must be IMMEDIATELY VISIBLE when scanning the person list. Users should not have to hover or click to know if a person has media.

OUTPUT: Provide code changes with clear file paths. Minimal changes to existing code.
