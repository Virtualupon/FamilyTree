First, read and understand the project structure:

1. Read the database schema: `B:\Development\Apps\repo\FamilyTree\backend\Schema_DATABASE_03.sql`
2. Explore the backend folder: `B:\Development\Apps\repo\FamilyTree\backend\` - read all API routes, models, controllers, and services
3. Explore the frontend folder: `B:\Development\Apps\repo\FamilyTree\frontend\` - focus on D3 diagram components and how person click events are handled

After understanding the codebase, implement the following feature:

## Feature: Relationship Finder Between Two People

### Objective
When a user clicks on a person in the D3 family tree diagram, they should be able to:
1. Search for any other person in the entire database
2. Select a person from search results
3. Click "Show Link" to see an org chart visualization showing the complete relationship path between both people
4. Each person node in the path should display detailed information

### Requirements

#### Backend
1. **Person Search API** - Create an endpoint to search all persons by name (supports partial matching), returning: ID, full name, birth/death dates, photo, and a brief identifier. Paginate results.

2. **Relationship Path Finder API** - Create an endpoint that accepts two person IDs and returns:
   - The shortest path between them (using BFS algorithm)
   - Each node in the path with FULL person details (name, birth date, birth place, death date, death place, gender, occupation, bio, photo, and any other available fields from the database)
   - The relationship type between each consecutive pair (e.g., "father of", "married to", "sibling of")
   - A human-readable relationship description (e.g., "2nd Cousin Once Removed", "Great Uncle", "Father-in-law")
   - Common ancestors if applicable

3. **Relationship Calculator** - Implement logic to correctly name relationships:
   - Direct line: Parent, Grandparent, Great-grandparent, Child, Grandchild, etc.
   - Collateral: Sibling, Aunt/Uncle, Niece/Nephew, Cousin (with degrees and removals)
   - In-laws: Father-in-law, Sister-in-law, etc.
   - Step relations: Step-mother, Step-sibling, etc.

#### Frontend
1. **Enhanced Click Handler** - When clicking a person node in the D3 diagram, show options including a "Find Relationship To..." button

2. **Person Search Modal** - A modal/dialog with:
   - Search input (debounced, 300ms)
   - Results list showing photo, name, dates, location
   - Ability to select a person
   - "Show Link" button to find the relationship

3. **Relationship Path Org Chart** - A new D3 visualization (horizontal or vertical org chart style) that:
   - Shows the complete path from Person A to Person B
   - Each node displays detailed person info (photo, name, dates, places, occupation, bio)
   - Connection lines are labeled with the relationship type
   - Header shows the overall relationship description
   - Nodes are clickable to expand/show more details
   - Supports zoom and pan for long paths

### Implementation Notes
- Follow existing code patterns and conventions in the project
- Use the same styling/theming as the existing D3 diagram
- Handle edge cases: no path found, same person selected twice, very long paths
- Make the UI responsive and user-friendly
- Add loading states during API calls
- Show meaningful error messages

Please analyze the existing code first, then implement this feature step by step, explaining your approach as you go.
